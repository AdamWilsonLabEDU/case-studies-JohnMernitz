Project Proposal to study Urban Tree Absence in Buffalo, NY
================
Jack Mernitz

# Introduction to the question

Urban tree coverage must change over time, however it seems removal
without placement is a more common trend of tree management by many
property owners. The albedo of tree leaves is higher than asphalt, and
shade provided alters the heat landscapes of neighborhoods.

# Directing Question

What kind of changes could planting trees on currently vacant sites
bring to the City of Buffalo?

# Inspiring Examples

## Example 1

<figure>
<img src="pnas.1817561116fig01.jpeg"
alt="This example is Figure 1 of Ziter et al. 2019:: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817561116" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">This example is Figure 1 of Ziter et
al. 2019:: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817561116"

</figure>

This set of graphics inspires me to display the tree occurrence data
across the City of Buffalo. A method of creating a map from this is
inputting the location data using Leaflet.

## Example 2

alt="This figure is a dendrogram from the R Graph gallery" />

This could be useful in creating a breakdown of tree species occurrence
and counts. It allows for grouping and size options for multiple
variables.

## Example 3

alt="This graphic is another way to categorize percent composition of trees" />

# Proposed data sources

[<i class="fa fa-file-code-o fa-1x" aria-hidden="true"></i> Open data
for the City of Buffalo’s Tree
Inventory](https://data.buffalony.gov/Quality-of-Life/Tree-Inventory/n4ni-uuec/data)

# Proposed methods

The packages used will include leaflet for map display of the coordinate
point data. Ggplot and ggraph to display data and counts according to
the dataset.

# Expected results

A detailed analysis of potential tree cover and projected cost savings.
Should vacant spaces have trees? What criteria would fit best for each
tree site?
