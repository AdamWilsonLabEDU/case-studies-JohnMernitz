# Introduction to the question

Urban tree coverage must change over time, however it seems removal without placement is a more common trend of tree management by many property owners. The albedo of tree leaves is higher than asphalt, and shade provided alters the heat landscapes of neighborhoods. 

# Directing Question 

What kind of changes could planting trees on currently vacant sites bring to the City of Buffalo?

# Inspiring Examples

## Example 1

![This example is Figure 1 of Ziter et al. 2019:: <https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817561116>](images/pnas.1817561116fig01.jpeg)

This set of graphics inspires me to display the tree occurance data across the City of Buffalo. A method of creating a map from this is inputting the location data using Leaflet.

## Example 2

![This figure is a dendrogram from the R Graph gallery](images/dendroexample.png)

This could be useful in creating a breakdown of tree species occurrence and counts. It allows for grouping and size options for multiple variables.

## Example 3

![]()

# Proposed data sources

[<i class="fa fa-file-code-o fa-1x" aria-hidden="true"></i> Open data for the City of Buffalo's Tree Inventory](https://data.buffalony.gov/Quality-of-Life/Tree-Inventory/n4ni-uuec/data)

# Proposed methods

List the approach you will use. Don't simply list packages, tell me what you will do with them.

# Expected results

Describe what you want to produce (graphics, analyses, etc.)
